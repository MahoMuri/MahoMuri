 Hey there! Nice of you to venture to my Profile! If you want to know a bit about me, then you've come to the right place! This README.md is designed just for you!
 
 ## About me
 I usually go by MahoMuri, but my friends know me by Kaito aswell. I am a 3rd Year Software Engineering Student from [iACADEMY](https://iacademy.edu.ph/index.php) who is now spending his months in quarantine making Discord Bots and a bit of Web Development. My main languages are TypeScript and Java, I am starting to learn .NET (Windows Forms) this year so I bet it's gonna be fun! You can checkout my repo for a [Simple Calculator](https://github.com/MahoMuri/SimpleCalculator) I made for a school project! I've also taken up a second degree in Web Development which gets me one step closer to becoming a Full Stack Developer! Hoping to have a fun adventure and would be able to learn a lot!
